# Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST) DUMPI Trace Library

#### Copyright (c) 2009-2022, National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC (NTESS)

---
The DUMPI library provides trace collection and trace replay tools for MPI applications.
The collection (dumpi) and replay (undumpi) tools can be enable in configure using:
````
--enable-libdumpi
--enable-libundumpi
````

To get started from a release, simply configure DUMPI using an MPI compiler.

To get started from a git download, run 
````
./bootstrap.sh
````
You can then configure using any MPI compiler.

Once installed, simply add 
````
-L$(PATH_TO_DUMPI) -ldumpi
````
to the LDFLAGS for your project. This will automatically embed DUMPI hooks into every MPI call.
Run your application as normal, and DUMPI will generate a file for each MPI rank containing the trace
in that folder. Trace collection is simple!

For trace replay, you will require the SST/macro tool. See the sst-macro repo and PDF manual for details on trace replay.
